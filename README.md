//This program will let the user pick from 30 different restaurants across 3 categories
//peer review: Jessie Lamzon
//Code looks good and when run randomizes chosen category.  I like how you used switch for this assignment too.  Only thing for validation is I typed random letters when choosing again and the program escaped.
